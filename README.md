# context-aware-emotion-analysis
Integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) for emotion detection using a pre-trained emotion classification model from Hugging Face (e.g., distilroberta-base). This model classifies sentences into emotions like anger, fear, happiness, and others based on their context, eliminating the need for simple sentiment analysis or keyword-based matching.
